# { File I/O Exercises. }

## Part 1 - Text Files

### 1. For the first part of this exercise assume you have a file called students.txt which simply contains a bunch of student names, one name per line. Your goal is to write two functions:

add_student - accepts a parameter of first_name and writes to a file called students.txt.
find_student - accepts a parameter of first_name and returns the first student found

#### Bonuses

### 1. Write the following additional functions:

* update_student - accepts a parameter of first_name and new_name and updates first student found
* remove_student - accepts a parameter of first_name and removes the student from the text file

### 2. Add a unique id for each student so that you can find a student by their id instead of first name (which breaks if you have the same first name for multiple students)

## Part 2 - CSV

### 1. For the next part of this exercise, you will be working with CSVs, so first create a file called users.csv and then work on the following two functions:

* one that prints out all of the first and last names in the users.csv file
* one that prompts a us to enter a first and last name and adds it to the users.csv file.

{ GitHub Exercises. }

Part I

Let's start by taking a bit of time to practice the git workflow below. It is so valuable to just practice this workflow a couple times, since you will most likely doing it professionally as well as in your individual projects and open source contributions. Here are some things to do.

1. Create a local repository and add and commit some files

mkdir new_repo
cd new_repo 
touch first.txt
touch second.txt
echo "stuff" > first.txt
echo things > second.txt
git init
git add .
git commit -m "initial commit"

2. Create a remote repository and push your code from the local repo to the remote

git push --set-upstream git@github.com:shriya/practice-repo.git master

3. Fork the repo https://github.com/rithmschool/git_practice - clone it and submit a pull request

(done in github)

4. Create a new branch locally and push it to GitHub

git checkout -B shriya_branch
touch file-in-branch.txt
git add .
git commit -m "branch"
git push --set-upstream origin shriya_branch

5. Submit a pull request with your new branch against the master branch on the git_practice repo.

(done in github)

{ Permissions, Redirection, and Piping Exercise. }

Part I (Permissions and links)

1. Create a file called restricted.txt.

touch restricted.txt

2. Change the permissions on the restricted.txt file to allow the owner to read and write to the restricted.txt file. Do this using the Octal Notation.

chmod 600 restricted.txt 

3. Change the permissions on the restricted.txt file to only allow the owner, group and everyone to read and write and execute the restricted.txt file. Do this using the Symbolic notation.

chmod ugo+rwx restricted.txt 

4. Create a folder called secret_files. Inside the secret_files folder create a file called first_secret.txt and another folder called classified. Inside of the classified folder create a file called super_secret.txt.

mkdir secret_files
cd secret_files 
touch first_secret.txt
mkdir classified
cd classified
touch super_secret.txt

5. Change the permissions on the secret_files to only allow the owner and group to read, write and execute in all the files and folders inside of secret_files. Do this using the Octal Notation.

chmod 770 secret_files 

6. Create a hard link for the restricted.txt called hard_link.

ln restricted.txt hard_link

7. Create a symbolic link for the classified folder called classified_link.

ln -s classified classified_link

Part II (Piping and Redirection)

1. Sort vegetables.txt.

sort vegetables.txt

2. Count the number of lines in vegetables.txt.

wc vegetables.txt

(15 lines)

3. Create a file called vegetables_sorted.txt which contains all the unique vegetables sorted in ascending order in vegetables.txt (do this without the touch command).

sort < vegetables.txt > vegetables_sorted.txt

4. Create a file called last_three.txt which contains the last three vegetables in the vegetables.txt file (do this without the touch command).

tail -n 3 vegetables.txt > last_three.txt

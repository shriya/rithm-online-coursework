## Part 1

### 1. What is an em?

An em is the default font size of an element, allowing you to define font sizes relative to the other font sizes within a parent element. For example, if you have three paragraphs inside a div and one of them should have font size double of the other, and the third be double of that one, you can define them by saying that their font sizes are 1em, 2em, and 4em (rather than giving absolute font sizes like 12px, 24px, 48px). 

### 2. What is the difference between em and rem?

An em is defined by the font size of the parent element, whereas a rem is relative to the root element (i.e. the <html> tag, so the whole page)

### 3. What is "mobile first" design?

Mobile First Design means designing a web page based on the small mobile site first, and *then* expanding out to a desktop-sized site from there (rather than trying to squish and dumb-down a desktop site); one of the advantages of this is that it forces you to only include the most important elements and pages on the site.

### 4. What is BEM?

BEM stands for Block, Element, and Modifier. Blocks are entities that have meaning on their own (like the menu/navigation), Elements are parts of blocks that are semantically tied to the blocks (like the nav items), and Modifiers are "flags on blocks or elements" i.e. signifiers of state changes or qualities (ex. a selected nav item). BEM is a way to create classes and name them in a consistent and easy to understand way for code reuse and minimal cascading/clashing issues.

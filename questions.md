# Questions 

### 2-html / 3-css / part3.css 

* why isn't this adding up to 500 width?!
* looks like there's some margin being added mysteriously around all elements

### 2-html / 3-css / part4.css 

* this also doesn't add up

### 4-js / 3-js / { Hoisting }

* this is supposed to throw and error but in my chrome console, but for me, it did not:

~~~~
sayHi("Matt"); // Throws an error!

var sayHi = function(name){
    return "Hello " + name;
}
~~~~
